Repository for Comunication Architecture (Arquiteturas de Comunicação) university course. The main objective of this course is to provide an integrated view of the architectures of large public communication networks, encompassing aspects such as network requirements, services, users, management, multimedia communications, and service virtualization and distribution.

By the end of this course, students are expected to:

1. Understand the evolution of telecommunications systems.
2. Grasp the support of services and technologies in an operator environment, including management, transport protocols, signaling, and multimedia systems.
3. Comprehend current network architectures and virtualization trends.

The teaching methodology, grounded in real-world examples of operator networks, allows students to critically assess current telecommunications network architectures. Additionally, it solidifies concepts through the transposition of theoretical concepts into laboratory experiences and exploration tasks.

The theoretical exposition and evaluation enable students to demonstrate the acquired competencies in terms of fundamental architectural knowledge of current communication networks. Interactive class formulation allows students to reflect on the networks and services they use daily and develop sensitivity to the reasons behind certain situations they encounter.

Practical classes are crucial for students to bridge the gap between architectural concepts and technological limitations that may sometimes restrict their applicability. Practical assessment enables students to showcase competencies in the main guiding technologies of current complex telecommunication system architectures.

Achieved final grade of 18 out of 20.
